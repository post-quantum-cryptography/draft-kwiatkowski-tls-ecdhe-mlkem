This draft serves as the necessary \"stable reference\" to get the identifier through the \"Expert Review process\". It should not be considered as a draft that will keep getting updated and ratified.\r\n\r\n[draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design/) was agreed in the TLS WG to be the standards draft which will give us the identifiers for the final ML-KEM spec like `secp392-mlkem768` or `secp392-mlkem1024` or `x25519-mlkem768`.
