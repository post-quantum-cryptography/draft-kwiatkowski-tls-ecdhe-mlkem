1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   ML-KEM is a key encapsulation method (KEM) defined in the [FIPS203].
   It is designed to withstand cryptanalytic attacks from quantum
   computers.

   This document introduces three new supported groups for hybrid post-
   quantum key agreements in TLS 1.3: the X25519MLKEM768,
   SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024 which combine ML-KEM with
   ECDH in the manner of [hybrid].

   The first one uses X25519 [rfc7748] and is an update to
   X25519Kyber768Draft00 [xyber], the most widely deployed PQ/T hybrid
   combiner for TLS v1.3 deployed in 2024.

   The second one uses secp256r1 (NIST P-256) [ECDSA] [DSS].  The goal
   of this group is to support a use case that requires both shared
   secrets to be generated by FIPS-approved mechanisms.

   The third one uses secp384r1 (NIST P-384) [ECDSA] [DSS].  The goal of
   this group is to provide support for high security environments that
   require use of FIPS-approved mechanisms.

   All constructions aim to provide a FIPS-approved key-establishment
   scheme (as per [SP56C]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiated Groups

   All groups enable the derivation of TLS session keys using FIPS-
   approved schemes.  NIST's special publication 800-56Cr2 [SP56C]
   approves the usage of HKDF [HKDF] with two distinct shared secrets,
   with the condition that the first one is computed by a FIPS-approved
   key-establishment scheme.  FIPS also requires a certified
   implementation of the scheme, which will remain more ubiqutous for
   secp256r1 in the coming years.

   For this reason we put the ML-KEM shared secret first in
   X25519MLKEM768, and the ECDH shared secret first in SecP256r1MLKEM768
   and SecP384r1MLKEM1024.

   Note: The group name X25519MLKEM768 does not adhere to the naming
   convention outlined in Section 3.2 of [hybrid].  Specifically, the
   order of shares in the concatenation has been reversed.  This is due
   to historical reasons.

3.1.  Construction

3.1.1.  Client share

   When the X25519MLKEM768 group is negotiated, the client's
   key_exchange value is the concatenation of the client's ML-KEM-768
   encapsulation key and the client's X25519 ephemeral share.  The size
   of the client share is 1216 bytes (1184 bytes for the ML-KEM part and
   32 bytes for X25519).

   When the SecP256r1MLKEM768 group is negotiated, the client's
   key_exchange value is the concatenation of the secp256r1 ephemeral
   share and ML-KEM-768 encapsulation key.  The ECDHE share is the
   serialized value of the uncompressed ECDH point representation as
   defined in Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446].  The size of the client
   share is 1249 bytes (65 bytes for the secp256r1 part and 1184 bytes
   for ML-KEM).

   When the SecP384r1MLKEM1024 group is negotiated, the client's
   key_exchange value is the concatenation of the secp384r1 ephemeral
   share and the ML-KEM-1024 encapsulation key.  The ECDH share is
   serialised value of the uncompressed ECDH point represenation as
   defined in Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446].  The size of the client
   share is 1665 bytes (97 bytes for the secp384r1 and the 1568 for the
   ML-KEM).

3.1.2.  Server share

   When the X25519MLKEM768 group is negotiated, the server's key
   exchange value is the concatenation of an ML-KEM ciphertext returned
   from encapsulation to the client's encapsulation key, and the
   server's ephemeral X25519 share.  The size of the server share is
   1120 bytes (1088 bytes for the ML-KEM part and 32 bytes for X25519).

   When the SecP256r1MLKEM768 group is negotiated, the server's key
   exchange value is the concatenation of the server's ephemeral
   secp256r1 share encoded in the same way as the client share and an
   ML-KEM ciphertext returned from encapsulation to the client's
   encapsulation key.  The size of the server share is 1153 bytes (1088
   bytes for the ML-KEM part and 65 bytes for secp256r1).

   When the SecP384r1MLKEM1024 group is negotiated, the server's key
   exchange value is the concatenation of the server's ephemeral
   secp384r1 share encoded in the same way as the client share and an
   ML-KEM ciphertext returned from encapsulation to the client's
   encapsulation key.  The size of the server share is 1665 bytes (1568
   bytes for the ML-KEM part and 97 bytes for secp384r1)

   For all groups, the server MUST perform the encapsulation key check
   described in Section 7.2 of [FIPS203] on the client's encapsulation
   key, and abort with an illegal_parameter alert if it fails.

   For all groups, the client MUST check if the ciphertext length
   matches the selected group, and abort with an illegal_parameter alert
   if it fails.  If ML-KEM decapsulation fails for any other reason, the
   connection MUST be aborted with an internal_error alert.

   For all groups, both client and server MUST process the ECDH part as
   described in Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446], including all validity
   checks, and abort with an illegal_parameter alert if it fails.

3.1.3.  Shared secret

   For X25519MLKEM768, the shared secret is the concatenation of the ML-
   KEM shared secret and the X25519 shared secret.  The shared secret is
   64 bytes (32 bytes for each part).

   For SecP256r1MLKEM768, the shared secret is the concatenation of the
   ECDHE and ML-KEM shared secret.  The ECDHE shared secret is the
   x-coordinate of the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point
   represented as an octet string as defined in Section 7.4.2 of
   [RFC8446].  The size of the shared secret is 64 bytes (32 bytes for
   each part).

   For SecP384r1MLKEM1024, the shared secret is the concatenation of the
   ECDHE and ML-KEM shared secret.  The ECDHE shared secret is the
   x-coordinate of the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point
   represented as an octet string as defined in Section 7.4.2 of
   [RFC8446].  The size of the shared secret is 80 bytes (48 bytes for
   the ECDH part and 32 bytes for the ML-KEM part).

   For all groups, both client and server MUST calculate the ECDH part
   of the shared secret as described in Section 7.4.2 of [RFC8446],
   including the shared secret check as described in Section 5.7.1.2 of
   [SP56A] or the all-zero shared secret check (depending on the curve),
   and abort the connection with an illegal_parameter alert if it fails.

4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those described in [hybrid] apply
   to the approach used by this document.  The security analysis relies
   crucially on the TLS 1.3 message transcript, and one cannot assume a
   similar hybridisation is secure in other protocols.

   Implementers are encouraged to use implementations resistant to side-
   channel attacks, especially those that can be applied by remote
   attackers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers three new entries to the TLS
   Supported Groups registry, according to the procedures in Section 6
   of [tlsiana].  These identifiers are to be used with the final,
   ratified by NIST, version of ML-KEM which is specified in [FIPS203].
